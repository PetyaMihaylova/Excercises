//you have to save more than 1 key: the text of your to-do,
//the status of your to-do: complete or Not
//and every time the page loads, you have to check
//somewhere, whether you had saved all to-dos, and on that basis
//for each of these to-dos to create the necessary html and js
//to add the eventlisteners and to show them on the page when the page loads
//afterwards, the possibility to add new and remove all todos.
// however, when you close the browser and have to return to your todos, they will be there.

Take the Session Storage, Local Storage and Cookies and update the ToDo application 
so that the ToDos are remembered e.g. in the Session Storage and when the application
loads, to check, whether you have saved ToDos, and if you have, for them to appear below in the screen,
so that the application works as expected. Not that, when you close the application, for all of the
ToDos to have disappeared.
