If we go to "Products", for each product we are gonna get a different set of meta tags. Each separate product is going to get a separate page for itself. In front-end development, we only create single-page applications. If we create multi-page applications, we are in the back-end. There is a way to change the set of metatags for each individual product, but it is quite complicated.-->
